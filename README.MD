Welcome to **GitDownLoader** – the no-nonsense, sassy Git repository manager that does exactly what you need (and none of the boring fluff). Got a mountain of repos to clone? We got you covered with a cool UI, live progress tracking, and the ability to pause or abort at your whim. Because, seriously, who has the time?

## Features

- **Add & Manage Repositories**: Paste in your Git URL, and watch as your repo list magically updates.
- **Live Progress Tracking**: Monitor clone progress, speed, and ETA – we're brutally honest about the numbers.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Need a coffee break? Pause your downloads and resume when you're ready for more action.
- **Abort Downloads**: When things go south, hit ‘Abort’ and just walk away. No drama.
- **Modern, Custom-Themed UI**: Built with Tkinter and dressed in a custom theme that’s as sassy as you are.

## Use Cases

- **Bulk Cloning**: Perfect for those days when you decide to clone every single repo you own (or admire).

- **Personal Repo Management**: Organize your personal projects in one place – because your hard work deserves a cool manager.
